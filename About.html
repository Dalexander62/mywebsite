	I am a self-taught photographer from the UK.
	<br> My photographer style is about being in the moment, capturing the image as I see it in its most intimate revealing the vulnerabilty, and I firmly believe this is the most compelling way to tell a story. Some of my idols include Elliott Erwitt, Steve McCurry and Robert Capa.  </p>

		I became interested in coding for two main reasons, one being my brother, who is a lead software engineer for a start-up in London, and second being the TV show Silcon Valley because, well, it's a great show. After numerous talks with my brother, and watching the show, I started to do my own research on coding and software engineering. My initial thought was that you needed to be a genius to understand it but in reality you don't. And so I came across Code Nation, and now here I am! Much like I find manipulating images a lot of fun, it's even more impressive what you can do with code!</p>

<p>One of the things I enjoy most about photography is the opportunity to explore. When I travelled the likes of the USA and Asia, it opened me up to so many new cultures, people, landscapes, and different ways of living which inspires me the most. 
	<br>
	<br>
I think coding and photography have many similarities, and by this I mean as long as you have a laptop, or a camera, you can work from almost anywhere in the world. Or You could be working on a project for an employer that is half the world away and you could be in your hometown is perplexing, yet taken for granted. I hope one day that I can utilise the skills I've learned during my time with code nation to future projects anywhere in the world!</p>
